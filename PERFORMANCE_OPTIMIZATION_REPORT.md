## 🎯 Reference Website Analysis

The reference website (executivestudyabroad.com) follows these performance principles:
- **Clean, minimal design** with subtle animations
- **Fast loading** with optimized images
- **Simple hover effects** instead of complex animations
- **Professional appearance** without heavy visual effects
- **Mobile-first approach** with responsive design

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Removed Components:
- `FloatingElements` - Excessive floating particles
- `BorderBeam` - Complex border animations
- `Earth/Globe` - Heavy 3D globe component
- `EduexpertAnimations` - Over-engineered animation system

### Simplified Animations:
```css
/* Before: Complex Framer Motion animations */
<EduexpertFadeInUp delay={0.2} duration={1.2}>
  <EduexpertSlideInRight delay={0.4} duration={0.8}>

/* After: Simple CSS animations */
<FadeIn delay={200}>
```

### Optimized Structure:
- Removed excessive animation wrappers
- Simplified state management
- Reduced component complexity
- Better performance characteristics

## 🚀 Performance Recommendations

### 1. **Image Optimization**
```tsx
// Replace <img> with Next.js Image component
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src={destination.image}
  alt={destination.name}
  width={400}
  height={300}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>
```

### 2. **Lazy Loading**
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Use Intersection Observer for animations
- Load testimonials and success stories on demand

### 3. **Code Splitting**
- Split large components into smaller chunks
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Implement route-based code splitting

### 4. **Caching Strategy**
- Implement proper caching headers
- Use CDN for static assets
- Cache API responses appropriately
